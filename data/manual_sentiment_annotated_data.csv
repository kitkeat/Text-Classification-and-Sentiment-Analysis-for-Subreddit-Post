13206,0,spoiler warning the batman detective movie rant spoiler warning ve been reading all these rave reviews about the batman movie pretty much all of them wildly positive the most reoccuring theme being it showcases batman as detective like never before and praising this new universe as the most comic accurate talking about how clayface or mr freeze would fit right in the next installment then watched it now don take this the wrong way performances were great catwoman was great riddler was great but this does not showcase batman as detective riddler is steps ahead of batman the whole movie the discussion of the crime scenes is gordon parroting batman saying how bad things are apart from when he unintentionally keeps rhyming with toddlers rhymes rolling on the floor laughing the comparison with seven is apt because in that movie the detectives also have no idea how to catch that guy and fall right into his plan however at least they realise what his plan is just finished watching the movie and have no idea what toddlers plan was expose that the famous maroni drug bust was fraud then flood the city and assassinate the mayor because why get that it like year one batman and he working out the bugs but like he has no idea wtf is going on they just go from crime scene to crime scene to crime scene reacting to the riddler then spot him in window right after batman fell into his trap then arrest him there no deduction or anticipating riddlers moves if the realisim is how batman would actually function staying awake all night and all day for months then they nailed it his one remaining brain cell thinks parrot is helping him solve cases also like that actor but gordon was really bad like not even his own character and also doing bale voice the whole time was hyped when people were talking about mr freeze and clayface being options for the next movie but dunno how you see that happening clayface requires batman to have an ability as detective and freeze requires scifi but they couldn even do bat wings movie is in no way bad just not at all what it being hyped to be rant over one last thing after seeing zoe kravitz play such an effortlessly great catwoman how did wb fail so epically at solo catwoman movie,NEU

15753,0,the batman box office let just start with the fact this movie does not need billion to be success and the people who created that narrative are stupid as fuck and are at fault for the people that wanted this movie to flop now having this narrative that the batman is disappointment the fact of the matter is it has grossed in weeks domestically is already ahead of man of steel in only weeks and as soon as this week it ll pass batman superman and will probably end its domestic run over which means it ll end as top five dc movie all of time financially when it comes to global bo it ll probably end it run anywhere between and give or take it ll end above man of steel and just around wonder woman and batman superman to put things into perspective the batman which is hours long noir serious murder mystery film with few actions sequences and little cgi will end it run with around the same money batman superman the first movie to ever put together two of the world greatest heroes and also the first movie to debut the greatest female superhero as well made bvs couldn even top and had awful legs sinked like rock to the bottom of the ocean after opening week and if talking so much about mos and bvs it because sick of the snyder fans finding every way possible to put the batman unequivocal success into question to make up for the fact their favorite movies underperformed and big time and absolutely love bvs and mos but am beyond tired of the snyder fans who shit on everything dc that doesn have zack snyder attached deal with it the batman is success the batman will get sequels the batman already has spin offs on the way and this is only the first film,NEG

17774,0,loved the tone of the batman it seems like nowadays superhero movies and tv shows are so terrified to take themselves seriously for the risk of being called joyless or not entertaining cause they re no fun that they all need joke to be cracked whenever the seriousness starts boiling in the pan and know certain characters lend themselves to having more humor and such spider man for instance needs to be mocking his villains and cracking one liners cause that just his personality but lot of superhero movies and shows nowadays just can help themselves but to insert jokes even when it not necessary just to break the tension and remind you hey this is silly comic book movie don take it too seriously batman is dark character he is perfectly suited to having dark stories but that doesn mean he doesn have sense of humor he actually usually has very dry sense of humor so obviously the batman could have had few gags and jokes and one liners and it would feel character appropriate and make no mistake there are handful of funny moments in the batman but not to the point of giving the viewer tonal whiplash like lot of other comic book films shows do the batman is pretty straightforward it entirely tonally consistent and knew to take itself seriously of the time it was dark and serious murder mystery crime drama and loved it hope to see more superhero films not necessarily ape it by being deadly serious all the time but at least stop feeling the need to remind people you re watching something silly so have some laughs all the time,POS

12424,0,since the batman is confirmed the batman heart of ice the batman sets up several hints or nods of what could come next most notably precursor to venom adrenaline injections are clear and the shot bruce used on himself in the finale is tinted green just like venom usually is in the comics and most media of bane flooded portions of gotham city give way for the introduction of half man half crocodile monster being reported killing rescue workers and those unlucky enough to be trapped in the flood zone the mayor son is someone bruce obviously sympathizes with and probably wishes he could help through his grief it unlikely but he could be robin one day or even grow up to blame batman for his father death if he learns that batman was the one the card was written to therefore leading the son to believe batman was complicit and catalyst to his father death mr elliott and the hush written over top his image during riddler fun little slideshow of the wayne cover ups and shady dealings so we could see hush in the future the two greeting cards both bear striking imagery on them that either unknowingly allude to or outright hint at two other batman villains the owl from crime scene being possible hints towards court of owls storyline which would fit in perfectly with how deep the level of control goes into gotham underworld over gotham and the card from the rat maze bearing resemblance to hugo strange the round rim bald up top and gorgeously bearded mad scientist joker being teased goes without saying though do hope they keep him in arkham for at least another movie or two or even better never make him the starring villain in this franchise carmine death could be lead in for alberto to become the holiday killer which if investigated could lead batman to take trip to arkham to interrogate calendar man oswald is set to become gotham next big crime boss and it unknown whether maroni is dead or simply in prison but wager prison that could lead into future mob violence between the crime families as well but enough hints and speculation let talk about the what if of the sequel if we do get mr freeze as the title villain the here my wishlist below returning cast aside would like to see the following actors and actresses casted for the new additions to the franchise michael fassbender victor fries kristina hendricks nora fries lakeith stanfield waylon jones ferris boyle nathan fillion harvey dent john hamm janice porter amanda seyfried plot opens on continued rescue efforts and flooding in gotham with many still stranded within the affected flood zone reports of reptilian monster have been becoming more frequent rescue workers and civilian holdouts have gone missing allegedly drug under the murky water and never seen again bruce sets trap for the monster thinking it simply some overgrown crocodile or possibly just shark from the harbor now trapped and starving in the flooded waters of gotham however when his trap goes off thrashing humanoid figure is raised from the water and in moment of shock the creature is able to sever the netting and escape the trap diving back into the water and disappearing yet again bruce looks into possible contingencies now that whatever he trying to catch seems to have human intelligence and cognition meaning second trap won work so simply he proposes plan to flash freeze the water around the creature to either force it to the surface or lower its temperature to the point of submission so it can be safely detained he turns to wayne enterprises medical amp division but the head of the division says that their research is probably months if not years away from being reality but she tells bruce of brilliant scientist who specializes in cryogenics that works for gothcorp headed by fellow billionaire ceo ferris boyle bruce meets with boyle to inquire about meeting this genius in their cryogenics department to which boyle is suspicious believing that bruce is their to render an offer to the man to come work for wayne enterprises boyle introduces bruce to dr victor fries and the two are left to talk bruce asks what gave victor such an interest in cryogenic research to which fries answers that his wife has cancer and he wishes to find way to cryogenically freeze cancer cells in way that they could be removed while frozen and stop the regrowth of any malignant cells the research is still in its early stages but he has manufactured small device that can flash freeze anything on contact bruce tells victor that he would be interested in if larger version of the medical device could be built to be larger and pack more powerful punch he tells the fries that he is aiding the police with whatever he can give them for the flood relief efforts and that something they could use to trap or subdue the reptilian creature in the waters could be very useful to them victor is uneasy about the idea but bruce assures him that they want to humanely capture the creature adding that the reports and sketches of it seems humanoid and bruce is suspicious that it may very well be sentient intelligent being victor agrees to work on something in his free time if he gets any we then cut to mayor re√°l meeting with da hopeful maverick attorney harvey dent who is lookin to fill the hole of the deceased gil colson he is running against janice porter junior of his when he was still and young attorney for wilcox stevens amp russ he talks about his plans to be stiff with both the gcpd as well as the organized criminal element to wash out any corruption among the police force and sever any ties possible between them and the crime families clambering to fill falcone vacated throne as crime boss of all crime bosses cut to janice porter entertaining house party for potential supporters and backers at her modest yet immaculate home in clean cut suburb outside gotham city proper as the party winds down and guests filter out we follow janice into her bedroom which is locked with key she wears behind her necklace as she enters the room it evident that the spotless home she owns is front fa√ßade lie her room is mess of newspapers pinned up photos and torn pages of journal and photos strewn about so that no matter where you look one face is always visible harvey dent she sits down at her desk in her room and opens up journal labeled no the issue number that harvey was introduced to batman comics she begins writing and narrating her dinner date with friends and her husband harvey embellishing details to make it seem as if her and harvey are an item and have been for some time we then go back to gothcorp where boyle is irate with the medical applications department for losing one of their test subjects in their cancer treatment trials he threatens the team with termination from the company as well as blacklisting them from working in their respective fields again if they can track down the subject and reacquire it victor completes his flash refrigeration encasement extraction zero endangerment gun he contacts bruce to relay the good news he also asks bruce if he would be able to tag along and observe the utilization of the device in the field for research and safety measures bruce agrees and tells victor that they will be accompanied by his other concerned parties but doesn say who the next evening bruce lieutenant gordon sergeant martinez and some gcpd uniforms show up to flooded building in which reports have seen the creature frequent so it may be its place of refuge or even makeshift home it dark but the gcpd have given everyone night vision goggles to see since flashlights would most likely alert the creature of their presence as they get closer to the center of the building another figure steps from the shadows the batman he keeps his distance but tells them to be quiet he scouted the building over and knows where the creature rests he leads the entourage to nook in one of the lobby corners and points to an opening in pile of ship shod driftwood and miscellaneous wreckage batman nods to the freeze gun to which bruce says it probably best if the vigilante is responsible for its use victor reluctantly hands it over and batman pulls device from his belt and tosses it into the water about ten meters or so away from the opening of the makeshift structure before them when the device hits the water it begins spinning and pulsing sending ripples throughout the water at first nothing happens then suddenly the creature bursts up from the murky waters swallowing the device in thrashing motion above the surface batman aims and fires the freeze gun hitting the creature in the neck and chest and to everyone surprise it immediately effective once throughly frozen in block of ice floating in the water secondary crew is brought in and the creature is crane lifted out and then placed in freezer trailer unit of semi truck and is to be transported to the gotham biological institute to be studied and treated if need be victor turns to ask naan for his tech back but the freeze gun has been propped against nearby table and the batman is nowhere to be seen cut to harvey stepping out of his car and headed inside an outline of feminine figure standing across the street in the shadows staying perfectly still until the door to harvey place closes shut the figure then turns and walk away down the sidewalk humming cheery tune bruce returns to the batcave to find clean shaven and lower half of face painted alfred only halfway out of the batsuit complaining at how heavy and cumbersome it is and how he could barely see damn thing in that bloody cowl he asks alfred to remove the contact lens in his eye for analysis then dons the suit himself before heading back out to the building the creature was caught in taking the batmobile as far as he can before gliding and grappling building to building to get back over the waterlogged city blocks he comes to find the gcpd have taped off the area but enters anyways searching delicately through the wreckage with infrared and night vision for any clues as to who or what the creature is he pulls custom goggles from his belt and fastens them over his cowl before pulling miniature respirator and removing his cape then diving below the surface after searching for few minutes he comes across locked trunk underneath and behind piece of sheet metal resting just above the surface of the water he cuts the lock and opens it to find what seems to be keepsakes for person not monster included is picture of young black man and an older woman he surmises it could be the mother to the young man he also finds some crumpled and wrinkled cash handgun and handful of bullets the picture in the frame is partially water damaged and therefore the facial recognition function of the contact lens is rendered useless he scans for fingerprints and finds match harriet jones he asks alfred to run search on information pertaining to ms jones turns out she an employee for gothcorp and that all got this far hit wall but ideally like to see it uncovered that waylon jones was being treated with experimental cancer cures involving the very volatile and unsure study of crocodile blood and was mutated as result nora fries would confront boyle herself when her husband wouldn after one of her friends also wife of gothcorp scientist told her about boyle threats of cutting cancer treatment funding if waylon wasn found in heated argument in victor lab boyle would impulsively grab the freeze gun and shoot nora encasing her when it discovered that waylon is still conscious and can be safely resuscitated only due to his now cold blooded crocodilian nature victor is driven past his breaking point realizing that he can never thaw his wife from the ice without killing her in the process he come up with plan with friend from the gotham biological institute to inject himself with concoction invoking the genetic material of the attic ground squirrel

2149,1,the lack of representation in moon knight and my hopes for the future of marvel long post alert so the premiere episode of ms marvel came out today and it was fantastic ve heard countless people of muslim and pakistani backgrounds saying that this show captured the essence of living in religious muslim household that they were able to relate to the show this opened up some old wounds got while watching moon knight when moon knight trailer came out in january was very excited to see marc spector adapted to the big screen my main reason was because he would be marvel first jewish lead character and given the track record marvel had with other minority leads black panther shang chi etc had very high hopes that would finally have character could relate to as an orthodox jew in modern media but then the show came out and episode after episode began to realize that moon knight jewish ness wasn being mentioned assumed they save it for his inevitable backstory episode so checked imdb to see how many jewish crew members marvel had gotten on the project to make sure marc judaism was fairly represented surely at least the director will be jewish right said to myself but no the director was muslim none of the writing staff were jewish there was one jewish person in the entire crew and it was reform jewish rabbi compare that to ms marvel whose cast crew and everything else is muslim or shang chi who had mostly asian cast and crew or black panther who had nearly an entirely black cast black director and black writer and then episode of moon knight came out and watched as marvel completely changed marc spector origin making its ties to judaism nonexistent honestly you could have made him any other religion and the story wouldn have changed at all was fuming by the end of the episode and almost didn watch the finale was disgusted that marvel paid no attention to marc jewish origins they didn even have jews on set so this is my plea marvel please make the next jewish character actually jewish whether it be kitty pryde iceman wiccan or speed or whoever else just give some jewish representation but my favorite option is making the thing an orthodox jew for those who don know in the original fantastic four comics the thing was essentially self insert for jack kirby and since jack kirby was jewish so was ben grimm and they did good job with him ben grimm had bar mitzvah after thirteen years of being rock monster he wore kippah and tallit during his wedding he was even featured on some old hanukkah cards https www google com search ben grimm hanukkah card amp sxsrf aliczsbjbn_lsqtzcbzz6yvguacuijfsng amp source lnms amp tbm isch amp sa amp ved ahukewjhxydhjp_4ahwvg_0hhxswdw8q_auoaxoecaeqaw amp biw amp bih amp dpr imgrc xlazmggzodu0rm so ask that the thing be marvel first true jewish lead character maybe have him joke that reed wouldn let him put tzitzit on his costume or how his tefillin don fit him anymore now that he rock monster maybe have the team go out to watch movie but ben says he can because it shabbat little things that just show that marvel cares about jewish representation not asking for much line here reference there maybe when they get hit with cosmic radiation in space ben can say the shema just want jewish character that and all other jews can relate to and know marvel has the ability to do it because they ve been able to do it for everyone else if christians daredevil muslims ms marvel blacks black panther falcon and the winter soldier and asians shang chi can all get accurate representations of their culture why can jews,POS

5845,1,how do we all feel about professor hulk personally am not fan don hate what they ve done with hulk but it seems like he comedic relief now instead of actually being hulk my favorite thing about the first two movies is hulk is really feared and you can feel this watching the movie feel like hulk is shell of his former self and not nearly as interesting as he used to be anyways what do you guys think of hulk now will say however did love him in thor ragnarok but in end game it went overboard felt and now with she hulk it looks like more of the same thoughts,NEG

3103,1,rewatched tasm and long time lurker with something to say first off tasm is really good adaptation of spider man the use of his webs during action sequences is highlighted perfectly something no other spider man movies replicates now to the point of this post captain stacy dennis leary to me is the best written character in the movie and would have liked to see him in the second film as was watching the finale of the movie at the top of oscorp tower it occurred to me that peter had the opportunity to save captain stacy by using the reptilian vial and having him recover from his mortal wounds the timing of this could be tricky given that peter still has to launch the antidote but think it could have been written into the movie easily enough obviously the lose of captain stacy and the promise that peter makes to him is the crux of tasm but the second movie needs rework anyhow anyways those are my thoughts what are yours,POS

7475,1,marvel phase failure serious question is it me of is this current phase of marvel pretty bad let me explain so far the numerous tv series have ranged from awful fatws to decent wandavision loki generally they all feel like they are weakening the mcu with poor stories weak villains and for the first time don feel like the mcu is building to grand avengers film after the poor showing don really care about new shows they re bringing in as for characters there are huge issues and feel they are have failed to build replacements for the loss of iron man and captain america wandavision and the multiverse of madness both tried to cast wanda in sympathetic light and imply she is not responsible for her deeds in wandavision she holds an entire town hostage with those people begging for death at one stage only to be told they ll never know what you sacrificed for them this is again repeated in multiverse of madness with dr strange saying you did the right thing in the end no matter how hard the writers try to make you feel sympathetic for her wanda is terrible person and has ruined many lives for her own selfishness hawkeye clint barton had no impact on the story and was complete bait and switch for kate bishop they completely butchered the kingpin who is meant to be monster and promptly gets beaten up by year old woman as for echo she was very forgettable and have no interest in her show dr strange he has turned from one the smartest heroes to complete idiot he could have easily told peter what his memory spell would do and then endangered the entire universe also in the multiverse of madness he tells wanda where america chavez is minutes after meeting her and he openly admits to not reading key book for the supreme sorcerer even though in the first film he dedicates his life to studying everything thor the first three thor films were all about building himself up to be true king and suddenly he has let himself go and reverted into being big man child who runs away from his responsibilities he straight up hands over rulership to drunkard he has known for minutes while he goes off to have jolly adventure loki complete badass in the first avengers film who promptly gets ko by woman with no powers with single punch he took straight shot from captain america and shrugged it off like it was nothing as for the films they have again ranged from good to awful the good spiderman was great aside from dr strange being an idiot shang chi great fight scenes but why did they need good awful cgi battle scene at the end with cady making that bullshit arrowshot the eternals less said the better just disaster from start to finish black widow an awful film that come years too late and ruined legendary villain from the comics apologies for the long post but just feel that there are numerous massive problems that marvel doesn care to acknowledge love this franchise but they could do so much better but just care about the easy cash grab please feel free to disagree agree with me,NEG
